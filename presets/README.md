# POVRay mosaic - Bitmap to 3D solid mosaic converter

Current folder contain preset include files for scenes, generated with POVRay mosaic.

Include files are made self-presenting, i.e. you may open an .inc file with POV-Ray separately from the main scene and render it, obtaining a preview of a single "thingie" object described in current .inc file. Therefore, you may perform batch rendering of all files in this folder and get previews for all of them at once.
